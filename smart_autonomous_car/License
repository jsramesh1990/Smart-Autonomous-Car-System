## **Key Integration Points**

1. **Unified Sensor Reading:** All sensors read simultaneously and stored in `SystemData` structure
2. **State Machine:** Smooth transitions between different operation modes
3. **Priority-based Decision Making:** In auto mode, obstacle avoidance takes highest priority
4. **Multi-layer Feedback:** 
   - LCD shows detailed information
   - 7-segment shows critical data
   - LEDs provide instant status
5. **Safety Features:**
   - Emergency stop function
   - Error detection and logging
   - Battery monitoring
   - Motor current protection

## **Advanced Features**

1. **Adaptive PID Control:** PID parameters adjust based on speed
2. **Data Logging:** Debug serial output for analysis
3. **Modular Design:** Easy to add new sensors or behaviors
4. **Configurable Parameters:** All settings in `config.h`
5. **Self-diagnostics:** System monitors its own health

This project successfully integrates all your modules into a cohesive, intelligent system that demonstrates advanced embedded systems principles while maintaining clean, modular code organization.
